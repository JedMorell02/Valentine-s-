            This song reminds me of how imperfect relationships can be, but what matters most is that you still choose each other every day. It's a reminder that love isn't about being perfect; it's about being there for each other, even through the flaws and challenges.

            I appreciate you for treating me right even tho we may fight sometimes but that doesn't mean don't love you anymore, I get mad at you sometimes because I care about you, don't ever think about me leaving you because that's not who I am. Even if the world is against you, I would still choose to be at your side no matter what happens. May God keep us safe from all the negative energies.

            Talking to you has quickly become one of my favorite parts of the
            day. Every time I see a message from you, I can't help but smile. It
            feels like my day instantly gets brighter just because of our
            conversation. You're not just great to look at; your personality
            makes you even more special.

            When I pray for you, hindi lang ako umaasa na maging maayos ang lahat. I'm asking God to keep you safe, to give you comfort when things are hard, and to fill your life with happiness and love. Sometimes words fail me in our conversations, but in prayer, I can express everything I want for you freely. It's how I show I care, sending my love to God, trusting he'll look after you in ways I can't.

            You are an inspiration, and I want you to know that I'll always be
            here for you, no matter what. If you ever need anything, I'm just a
            message away and will respond as soon as I can. My time is yours
            whenever you need it.

            Can we talk about how stunning you look in any outfit? Your
            confidence and the way you carry yourself are truly admirable. You
            have this amazing presence that captivates anyone around you, and
            your natural charm is simply undeniable.

            Before I met you, hindi ako naniniwala sa mga wishes. Para sa akin, 'yung pag-wish sa 11:11, birthday at kapag may nakita kang shooting star, gawa gawa lang ng mga tao. But everything changed when you came into my life. Ngayon, tuwing sasapit ang 11:11, ikaw agad ang naiisip ko, at ang laging laman ng aking mga kahilingan.

          <p> I never thought I'd actually believe in these kind of things. Pero dahil sa'yo, natutunan ko na wala namang mawawala kung susubukan ko, lalo na kung ikaw ang usapan. I wish I always had the time and the chance to tell you that you're the reason even simple moments feel so special.
